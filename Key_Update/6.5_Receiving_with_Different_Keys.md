For receiving packets during a key update, packets protected with older keys might arrive if they were delayed by the network. Retaining old packet protection keys allows these packets to be successfully processed.

在密钥更新期间，可能会接收到受旧密钥保护的数据包，它们因为被网络延误而刚刚抵达。保留旧的数据包保护密钥使得这些数据包能够被成功处理。

As packets protected with keys from the next key phase use the same Key Phase value as those protected with keys from the previous key phase, it is necessary to distinguish between the two if packets protected with old keys are to be processed. This can be done using packet numbers. A recovered packet number that is lower than any packet number from the current key phase uses the previous packet protection keys; a recovered packet number that is higher than any packet number from the current key phase requires the use of the next packet protection keys.

由于受来自下一阶段的密钥保护的数据包会与受来自上一阶段的密钥保护的数据包使用相同的密钥阶段，要想处理受旧密钥保护的数据包，就有必要区分这两种数据包。这可以通过使用数据包号来做到。如果重建出来的数据包号比当前密钥阶段的任一数据包号要小，那么这些数据包就要使用上一阶段的数据包保护密钥；如果重建出来的数据包号比当前密钥阶段的任一数据包号要大，那么这些数据包就要使用下一阶段的数据包保护密钥。

Some care is necessary to ensure that any process for selecting between previous, current, and next packet protection keys does not expose a timing side channel that might reveal which keys were used to remove packet protection. See Section 9.5 for more information.

为了确保在上一阶段、当前阶段和下一阶段的数据包保护密钥间选择的过程不会在计时侧信道上泄露最终用于移除数据包保护的是哪一组密钥，必须谨慎操作。有关更多信息，详见[第9.5章]()。

Alternatively, endpoints can retain only two sets of packet protection keys, swapping previous for next after enough time has passed to allow for reordering in the network. In this case, the Key Phase bit alone can be used to select keys.

作为替代方案，终端可以仅维护两组数据包保护密钥，只需在经过对网络重排序来说充足的时间后将上一阶段的密钥替换为下一阶段的密钥。在这种情况下，只需要密钥阶段比特位就足以选择密钥。

An endpoint MAY allow a period of approximately the Probe Timeout (PTO; see [QUIC-RECOVERY]) after promoting the next set of receive keys to be current before it creates the subsequent set of packet protection keys. These updated keys MAY replace the previous keys at that time. With the caveat that PTO is a subjective measure -- that is, a peer could have a different view of the RTT -- this time is expected to be long enough that any reordered packets would be declared lost by a peer even if they were acknowledged and short enough to allow a peer to initiate further key updates.

在将下一阶段的接收密钥提升为当前阶段后，终端{{< req_level MAY >}}在建立再下一组数据包保护密钥前等待一段约为一个探测包超时（PTO；详见《[QUIC恢复]()》）的时间。这组延迟建立的新密钥{{< req_level MAY >}}在经过这段等待时间后才替换上一阶段的旧密钥。只不过有一个缺点，即PTO是一个主观的测量结果——也就是说，对端对于RTT的预估可能不同——这段等待时间既应该足够长以使得所有乱序数据包都会被对端认定为丢包，即使它们被确认了，又应该足够短以使得对端可以发起后续的密钥更新。

Endpoints need to allow for the possibility that a peer might not be able to decrypt packets that initiate a key update during the period when the peer retains old keys. Endpoints SHOULD wait three times the PTO before initiating a key update after receiving an acknowledgment that confirms that the previous key update was received. Failing to allow sufficient time could lead to packets being discarded.

在对端保留旧密钥期间，对端可能无法解密发起密钥更新的数据包，终端需要允许这种情况的存在。在接收到能够肯定先前的密钥更新已经被接收到的确认后，终端在发起密钥更新前{{< req_level SHOULD >}}等待一段时长为PTO的三倍的时间。若没有留足时间，可能导致数据包被丢弃。

An endpoint SHOULD retain old read keys for no more than three times the PTO after having received a packet protected using the new keys. After this period, old read keys and their corresponding secrets SHOULD be discarded.

在接收到受新密钥保护的数据包后，终端保留旧的读取密钥的时长{{< req_level SHOULD >}}不超过PTO的三倍。在这段等待时间之后，旧的读取密钥和它们对应的秘密值{{< req_level SHOULD >}}被弃用。
