In this document, the TLS handshake is considered confirmed at the server when the handshake completes. The server MUST send a HANDSHAKE_DONE frame as soon as the handshake is complete. At the client, the handshake is considered confirmed when a HANDSHAKE_DONE frame is received.

在本文档中，在握手完成的同时，服务器一侧的TLS握手就可以被认定为已确认。一旦握手完成，服务器{{< req_level MUST >}}立即发送**握手完成帧**。而在客户端一侧，只有接收到**握手完成帧**后才能认定握手为已确认。

Additionally, a client MAY consider the handshake to be confirmed when it receives an acknowledgment for a 1-RTT packet. This can be implemented by recording the lowest packet number sent with 1-RTT keys and comparing it to the Largest Acknowledged field in any received 1-RTT ACK frame: once the latter is greater than or equal to the former, the handshake is confirmed.

除此之外，客户端{{< req_level MAY >}}在接收到对于某个1-RTT数据包的确认时将握手认定为已确认。这可以通过记录使用1-RTT密钥发送的最小数据包号，并将它与接收到的1-RTT**ACK帧**的最大确认数字段作比较，来实现：一旦后者大于等于前者，即可确认握手。
