In this document, the TLS handshake is considered complete when the TLS stack has reported that the handshake is complete. This happens when the TLS stack has both sent a Finished message and verified the peer's Finished message. Verifying the peer's Finished message provides the endpoints with an assurance that previous handshake messages have not been modified. Note that the handshake does not complete at both endpoints simultaneously. Consequently, any requirement that is based on the completion of the handshake depends on the perspective of the endpoint in question.

在本文档中，当TLS栈报告握手已完成时，就可以认定此次TLS握手完成。这一事件会在TLS栈发送了自己的已结束（`Finished`）消息并且验证了对端的已结束消息时发生。验证对端的已结束消息使得终端能够确信之前的握手消息没有受到篡改。注意，两侧的终端不是同时认定握手完成的。所以，任何基于握手完成这一时机的要求，该时机都是由终端在具体问题中的角色决定的。
